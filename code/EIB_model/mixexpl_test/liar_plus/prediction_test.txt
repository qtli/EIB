And the most generous census estimate prior to last year indicates net migration from other states equaled 143,000 people from July 2008 to July 2009, accounting for less than a third of the states population increase in the period. Looking at Texas population growth in terms of people moving here ""with their feet"" versus people born here, DeWhurst pegged the ratio correctly -- about half-and-half.
