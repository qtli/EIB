        "None of the African elections officials we spoke with heard of any case of someone walking 200 to 300 miles to vote. In fact, they wanted to know where Bennett got his information from. We searched news accounts of the recent elections in Chad, Uganda, Nigeria and elsewhere and found no instance of people walking hundreds of miles in order to vote.\n",
        "\"Former New Hampshire Speaker of the House William OBrien wrote that Margaret Sanger was the founder of Planned Parenthood and \"\"an active participant in the Klu Klux Klan. \"\"Birth-control advocate Sanger did give a speech to a womens branch of the KKK and she was a believer in eugenics.\"\n",
        "The money never existed in the first place. But she didn't miss the point.\n",
        "\"Trump said the number of illegal immigrants \"\"could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. \"\"Both figures are not within the range of possibility. Every credible estimate we found was in the 11 million range, with a margin of error of around 1 million. The figure has \"\"always\"\" been 11 million, in recent years, because of the flow of undocumented immigrants in and out of the United States.\"\n",
        "The median wage in the country, expressed in constant 2009 dollars, does appear to be in the range Maddow cited (though with statistics broken out separately for men and women, we can't be precise). It's not unreasonable to cite those numbers, but the economists we spoke to preferred to use figures that included capital gains, which show the top 1 percent saw an increase of 55 percent. Either way, Maddow's point that the 1980s were much more of a boon for the very rich than everyone else is valid.\n",
        "\"Rubio said that Romney was \"\"one of the first national Republican leaders to endorse me. \"\"Romney did endorse Rubio before Crist dropped out of the primary in 2010. But it was clear at the time that Rubio would have thumped Crist in a primary if Crist hadnt dropped out. But it bears noting that Romneys endorsement of Rubio was something less than a pioneering stand.\"\n",
        "Carr said before World War II, very few people had health insurance. While Carr doesnt take into account the advances in medical care over the past 75 years, hes right.

        "But spending still goes up. In addition, many outside factors can affect the cost and range of benefits, making it impossible to know how Medicare Advantage might change.

        "Meantime, engineering experts agree the wall would most likely take years to complete. Keep in mind, too, it took more than six years to build roughly 700 miles of fence and barriers along the roughly 2,000-mile U. S. -Mexico border.\n",
        "Legislators have opted to give 85 percent of the polluting permits away for free instead of putting them up for sale, as Obama pledged to do on the campaign trail. In theory, this approach should reduce costs to consumers. Furthermore, revenue from auctioned permits will help consumers pay for increased energy prices, according to Obama's first budget. Despite those potential cost cuts, there's still little disagreement that consumers will pay for cap-and-trade, whether it's $3,100 a year or $340.\n",
        "\"On Jan.  1, 2011, gross federal debt stood at just over $14 trillion, which works out to $45,433 for every American. So both of the figures Pawlenty used have a basis in reality, but they do not relate to each other the way he suggested. If Pawlenty wants to stick with the $30,000-per-person figure, he should have said that debt stands at more than $9 trillion. Alternately, if he prefers to stick with the \"\"more than $13 trillion\"\" debt figure, he should say that the amount of debt per person exceeds $45,000.\"\n",
        "Heavy water, which can be used to make a nuclear weapon, clearly is part of Irans nuclear program. And by reducing Irans heavy water stockpile, the purchase helps Iran comply with a nuclear agreement that is aimed at making it harder for the country to develop a nuclear weapon.\n",

        "\"Murphy said that Rubio \"\"said Social Security and Medicare have weakened us as a people,' \"\" he said. In a speech in 2011, Rubio talked about government programs intended to help people and said, \"\"These programs actually weakened us as a people. \"\"Rubio argued that people no longer had to worry about saving once they viewed it as the governments job and that the government supplanted the role of families and religious institutions to help people in need.\"\n",
        "The misery index in the current recession has been lower -- 5. 7 in 2008 and 11. 8 so far in 2009. The barometers we examined aren't necessarily equal measurements of the magnitude, but collectively they paint a picture that the current recession -- so far -- is worse than the one under Reagan. Even if we had decided to include inflation as a factor, the measurements would still indicate the current recession is worse.\n",
        "It roughly equals the total 13-year expenses of Virginias state government between 1999 and 2012. Allen is not only exaggerating the spending total by President Obama and the Democratic leaders of Congress, he is doing it by including billions of dollars passed under a Republican president. So we have to set the meter ablaze.\n",

He also supported a variety of ordinances needed for development of the Rhode Island Convention Center. Finally, he told us he added a handful of jobs to the Providence City Council office.\n",
        "The  point I was making is that Mr.  Doggetts ideology is considerably more  liberal than mine, and considerably more liberal than what many, many  Central Texans are telling me they want to see in their U. S.   representative. So, how does the doctors convention  charge stick?Doggett is  liberal, but hes by no measure the most liberal member of Congress,  voting analyses show. Campbell owned up after  we followed up.\n",
        "But we dont agree with the way Smith reached her number, by using clusters, and we dont think Lincoln should be included when none of Lincoln will be rebuilt by the proposed bond measure.

        "Yet by the time Brown appeared on CNN (three days after the administration announced the compromise), the deal was for two years, and it was that very deal that Brown went on the air to criticize. Even if the deal had been for 10 years, Brown misapplied the cost figure by describing the whole $700 billion as going to millionaires and billionaires. Joint Committee projections from earlier this year estimated that cost would be more like $327 billion over 10 years. Those are two key points on which Browns statement simply is not accurate.\n"
